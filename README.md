This a simple gesture based (watch looking gesture) alarm trigger solution. This can be a replacemment for mouse based / touch switch based trigger solution. One can have cross correlation function to recognise advaced gestures to implement various functions for each gesture by buffering  the motion sensor data and correlating with known patterns for cross correlations.
